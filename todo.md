## Todo List

### Phase 1: Analyze the existing dark theme and plan for a light theme counterpart
- [x] Analyze the existing dark theme's color palette and typography.
- [x] Define a new light theme color palette and typography that contrasts well with the dark theme.
- [x] Plan how to structure the CSS for both themes (e.g., using CSS variables or separate classes).

### Phase 2: Create a light theme CSS and integrate it
- [x] Create or modify `style.css` to include light theme styles, possibly using a class like `.light-mode`.
- [x] Ensure all major elements (background, text, cards, buttons, forms) have corresponding light mode styles.

### Phase 3: Implement a theme toggle switch in HTML and JavaScript
- [x] Add a toggle button (e.g., a sun/moon icon) to `index.html`.
- [x] Implement JavaScript in `script.js` to:
    - [x] Toggle a class (e.g., `light-mode`) on the `body` element.
    - [x] Save the user's preference to `localStorage`.
    - [x] Apply the saved preference on page load.

### Phase 4: Test the dark/light mode toggle and persistence
- [x] Open `index.html` in the browser and test the toggle switch.
- [x] Verify that all elements correctly switch between dark and light themes.
- [x] Test if the theme preference persists after refreshing the page or closing/reopening the browser.

### Phase 5: Deliver the updated website files
- [x] Provide the updated `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files to the user.
